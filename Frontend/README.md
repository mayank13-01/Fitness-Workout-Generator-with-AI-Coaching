## Project Structure

The frontend codebase follows a structured organization for better maintainability. Here's a brief overview of key folders:

- **`src/pages/`:** Contains individual page components, each representing a specific view of the application. For example, the Login page, Signup page, and Home page can be found here.

- **`src/util/auth.js/`:** Includes utility functions and components related to user authentication and authorization. This folder may contain files for handling user sessions, authentication routes, and private route components.

- **`src/components/`:** Houses reusable and shared components used across different pages. These components contribute to a consistent UI and codebase. Examples include Input components, Buttons, and other UI elements.

Feel free to explore these folders to understand the structure and locate specific functionalities within the codebase. This organization enhances code modularity and makes it easier to maintain and extend the application.
